A weird idea I had to make an histogram prime numbers, by how much numbers are divisible by it.
So for example, through all integer numbers from 2 to 1000 how much are divisible by the prime number 5? 200 obviously. 
This is harder for larger numbers. I simply wanted to plot that out, for some reason :)
