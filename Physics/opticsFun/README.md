This is real-time optic simulation attempt, using pygame and more.

Current state of the project is not bad.
1. User can change the coordinate from which the laser shoots, by clicking on screen with the mouse.
2. The laser shoots a stright line until it reaches the screen limits, unless it reachs an object.
3. There are stright line and circle mirrors object, which reflect every laser ray! Even the reflected rays.
4. Most mirror reflection methods are done. Many issues were solved. 
5. Still have one small bug - when a laser is pointed at a circular and line mirror in that order of proximity there is reflection from both :( . Will be resolved.
