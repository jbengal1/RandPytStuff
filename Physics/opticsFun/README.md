Current state of the project is not bad, though premature.
1. The user can change the 2d point from which the laser shoots from, by clicking on screen with the mouse.
2. The laser shoots a stright line until it reaches the screen limits.
3. There are stright line mirrors object, which reflect every laser!
4. Most mirror reflection methods are done. Many issues were solved.
