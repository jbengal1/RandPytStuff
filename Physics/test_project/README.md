A very premature particle collision project, using pygame. It is not the only one I've tried..
Most physics engine building attempts are not in my git hub, and are written in C++, which is harder but much more suitable. 

One C++ (with SFML) attempt can be found here:

And optics simulation done in python, using pygame, numpy, and more, can be found here:
